Task 2: Minimum Viable Product
Once your repository is set up, practice what you learned today to style the site according to the given design. 
Your complete project should look similar to the desktop image. You should take the following actions, 
at a minimum:

 - Link your CSS stylesheet in the index.html and impliment a CSS reset
 Markup html semantically, such that it can be styled according to the given desktop image
 - Color the background of items in the navigation bar and footer with the following colors:
      -Plan your Visit: #FF764E
      -Learn About the Park: #5ED3EB
      -Get Involved: #FFCD69

 - Change all font colors and styles according to design file
      -Yosemite Park Guide font is called Chelsea Market and can be found on google fonts
      -All other text is Roboto Mono, also available on google fonts
 - Color the background of the main text body with #DDB9A3
 - Color the background of the footer with #F9E7DC
 - Bold the words "current fire restrictions" and "park entrance fee" according to the design file
 - Apply box model properties (content, padding, margin, and border) to all content such that your webpage matches the design file. 
 - This will include at least:
 - A round image in the header
 - Round corners on navigation and footer items
 - Header image and text side by side
 - Centered content and margins around content
 - Footer image positioning
***Throughout your design you should avoid static units (pixels), and should instead use responsive units 
wherever possible.


Task 3: Stretch Goals
The following goals are designed to stretch your knowledge and may require additional research beyond 
what was learned in class today.

 - Add CSS animations (hover, mouseover, etc.)

 - Design and execute your own pages for Plan your Visit, Learn About the Park, or Get Involved
 
 - Use favicon.io to convert the campfire and RV images to real favicons and use them in your project
 
 - Host your website on Netlify.com
