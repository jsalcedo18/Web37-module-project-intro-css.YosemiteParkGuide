Task 2: Minimum Viable Product
Once your repository is set up, practice what you learned today to style the site according to the given design. 
Your complete project should look similar to the desktop image. You should take the following actions, at a minimum:

 Link your CSS stylesheet in the index.html and impliment a CSS reset
 Markup html semantically, such that it can be styled according to the given desktop image
 Color the background of items in the navigation bar and footer with the following colors:
 Plan your Visit: #FF764E
 Learn About the Park: #5ED3EB
 Get Involved: #FFCD69
 Change all font colors and styles according to design file
 Yosemite Park Guide font is called Chelsea Market and can be found on google fonts
 All other text is Roboto Mono, also available on google fonts
 Color the background of the main text body with #DDB9A3
 Color the background of the footer with #F9E7DC
 Bold the words "current fire restrictions" and "park entrance fee" according to the design file
 Apply box model properties (content, padding, margin, and border) to all content such that your webpage matches the design file. 
 This will include at least:
 A round image in the header
 Round corners on navigation and footer items
 Header image and text side by side
 Centered content and margins around content
 Footer image positioning
Throughout your design you should avoid static units (pixels), and should instead use responsive units wherever possible.
